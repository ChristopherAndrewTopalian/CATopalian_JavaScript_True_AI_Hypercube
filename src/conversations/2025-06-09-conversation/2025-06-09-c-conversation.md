# 🤖 True AI Logic Language  
### 🧠 256 Gate Combinations – Foundation for a Cognitive Grammar System  

This document defines a full set of **logic gate pairings** to serve as the symbolic structure for your **True AI logic grammar**. The combinations explore **cognition**, **inference**, and **logical behavior** by combining the foundational 16 logic gates two at a time (16 × 16 = 256).

---

## 🔢 Preview: First 10 Gate Combinations

Here is a preview of the **first 10 out of the 256 total logic gate pair combinations** (16 gates × 16 gates) that can serve as the basis for your True AI logic language:

1. **Tautology + Tautology**  
2. **Tautology + Contradiction**  
3. **Tautology + AND**  
4. **Tautology + NAND**  
5. **Tautology + OR**  
6. **Tautology + NOR**  
7. **Tautology + XOR**  
8. **Tautology + XNOR**  
9. **Tautology + Implication**  
10. **Tautology + Converse Implication**

Each pair could be thought of as a **logical sentence**, **rule**, or **interaction** in your symbolic reasoning system.

You now have a complete base of **256 combinational expressions** to explore:

- 🧠 Logic flows  
- 🔁 Transformations  
- 🤖 Simulated AI behavior  
- 🕸️ Multi-step cognition

## 🔧 Gate Definitions

```javascript
// list of your 16 logic gates
let logicGates =
[
    'Tautology',
    'Contradiction',
    'AND',
    'NAND',
    'OR',
    'NOR',
    'XOR',
    'XNOR',
    'Implication',
    'Converse Implication',
    'A',
    'NOT A',
    'B',
    'NOT B',
    'A then B',
    'B then A'
];
````

---

## 🔁 Gate Pair Generator

```javascript
// array to hold all gate pairs
let gatePairs = [];

// nested loop to generate 16 × 16 combinations
for (let i = 0; i < logicGates.length; i++)
{
    for (let j = 0; j < logicGates.length; j++)
    {
        let pair = logicGates[i] + ' + ' + logicGates[j];
        gatePairs.push(pair);
    }
}
```

---

## 🖨️ Output to Console

```javascript
// show all 256 combinations in the console
for (let k = 0; k < gatePairs.length; k++)
{
    console.log((k + 1) + '. ' + gatePairs[k]);
}
```

## 📈 Usage Ideas

* 🧬 Each gate pair is a **building block** of your logic language.
* 🧠 Use them to model **logical inferences**, **decision branches**, or **reasoning chains**.
* 🖼️ Display as a **logic map**, **circle**, **wheel**, or **hypercube edge labels**.
* ✨ Map to glyphs or UI icons in your AI interpreter.
* 🔁 Chain them together to express **recursive** or **evolving logic**.

---

## 📤 Optional Extensions

* Export to `JSON` or `CSV`
* Render as scrollable `<div>` in HTML for easy viewing
* Visualize on canvas/SVG/Three.js for 2D/3D hypercube display
* Integrate with your gate engine for logic testing or AI simulation

## 🔮 Want to Keep Building?

Would you like to:

* [ ] Add truth table logic per pair?
* [ ] Create glyphs or symbols for each gate?
* [ ] Render this as a scrollable HTML matrix or rotating logic wheel?
* [ ] Export full logic structure as JSON for use in your AI apps?

Just say the word and we’ll add the next piece to your AI toolkit. 💡🧠

Let me know and we’ll keep building the system that unlocks logic for AI and humans alike. 💫

```

Let me know if you want this exported as a `.md` file or turned into a visual interface!
