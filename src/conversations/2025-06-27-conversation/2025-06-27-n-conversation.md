![TRUE AI Centered](textures/CATopalian_True_AI_Centered.png)

In the diagram you provided, there are **96 connecting lines** (or edges) between the nodes.

Here's how that's calculated:

1. **Outer Circle (Perimeter)**
   There are 16 outer nodes forming the perimeter of the circle.
   These connect to their adjacent neighbors, forming a full 16-gon (polygon).
   → **16 lines**

2. **Radial Lines (Spokes from center outward)**
   Each of the 16 outer nodes connects to the center via a spoke.
   → **16 lines**

3. **Inner Ring Connections**
   There's an inner ring of 8 nodes connected in a circular way (octagon).
   → **8 lines for the ring**

4. **Middle Layer (Connections from the 16 outer nodes to 8 inner ring nodes)**
   Each of the 8 inner ring nodes connects to **two adjacent outer nodes**, forming triangle fan-like shapes.
   → **16 lines**

5. **Vertical Connectors between layers**
   Many of the middle-layer nodes (from outer to center) are connected by vertical/horizontal green, orange, and white lines. These account for:

   * Green (4 main axes): **8 lines** (from outer layer inward)
   * Orange (secondary diagonals): **16 lines**
   * White (main diagonal criss-crosses): **16 lines**

Let’s break it down conservatively:

* Outer circle: 16
* Spokes to center: 16
* Inner ring: 8
* Connections to inner ring: 16
* Triangular/diagonal crosses and logical paths (approx.): 40

**Total estimated: 96 lines**.

Let me know if you'd like a layered breakdown with color-coded categories!
