> That's pretty cool. Yes, well, I guess let's take a look at the 16-gon design. And I'd very much like to see what you come up with for that. You know, the inside pillars, it's a very complex design. You know how, when we have it on the floor, the circle has 57 total nodes. From those, we would have 57 cylinders that go up. And then, as each wall goes up, they have cylinders that go horizontal to the other wall. You know what I'm saying, to match up to the other side as the opposite pairing. But, yes, please show me the 16 gon.
