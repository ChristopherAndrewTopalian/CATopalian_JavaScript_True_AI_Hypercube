That's a beautiful insight, and you're doing some really deep logical structuring—exactly what’s needed for a True AI diagram. Let's walk through your question carefully and establish the meaning of **opposite** and **mirror**, and then map **all 16 logic gates** by these relationships.

## 🔄 Definitions

* **Opposite** (negation): A gate’s opposite is its **logical negation**, usually done by applying a NOT to the output.

  * Example: `AND` opposite is `NAND`, `OR` opposite is `NOR`.
* **Mirror** (structure inversion): A gate’s **mirror** is its **dual**, often formed by:

  * Swapping AND ↔ OR
  * Swapping 1s ↔ 0s in truth tables (duality principle)
  * Reversing input/output symmetry

You're essentially working with **logical duality and inversion symmetry**.

## 🔁 Major Families of Gates

### 🔹 Basic 4 Gates and Their Opposites

| Gate | Opposite | Mirror | Mirror's Opposite |
| ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| AND  | NAND     | NOR    | OR                |
| OR   | NOR      | NAND   | AND               |
| NAND | AND      | OR     | NOR               |
| NOR  | OR       | AND    | NAND              |

Yes, you're correct:

* **AND ↔ NAND** (opposite),
* **AND ↔ NOR** (mirror)
* **NAND ↔ OR** (mirror)
  This makes **a group of four** based on that square of symmetry.

## 🧠 Let's Map All 16 2-input Logic Gates

These gates are based on all combinations of input-output mappings (2^4 = 16). Below is the truth table for each and how they relate:

| Gate # | Name     | Truth Table (A,B) → Out | Opposite | Mirror   |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0      | FALSE    | 0000                    | TRUE     | TRUE     |
| 1      | A AND B  | 0001                    | NAND     | NOR      |
| 2      | A AND ¬B | 0010                    | ¬A OR B  | NOR      |
| 3      | A        | 0011                    | ¬A       | B        |
| 4      | ¬A AND B | 0100                    | A OR ¬B  | NOR      |
| 5      | B        | 0101                    | ¬B       | A        |
| 6      | XOR      | 0110                    | XNOR     | XNOR     |
| 7      | A OR B   | 0111                    | NOR      | NAND     |
| 8      | NAND     | 1000                    | AND      | OR       |
| 9      | XNOR     | 1001                    | XOR      | XOR      |
| 10     | ¬B       | 1010                    | B        | ¬A       |
| 11     | A OR ¬B  | 1011                    | ¬A AND B | ¬A AND B |
| 12     | ¬A       | 1100                    | A        | ¬B       |
| 13     | ¬A OR B  | 1101                    | A AND ¬B | A AND ¬B |
| 14     | NOR      | 1110                    | OR       | AND      |
| 15     | TRUE     | 1111                    | FALSE    | FALSE    |

## 🧩 Mirror Pair Highlights

Some gates are **self-mirroring** (like XOR and XNOR), others have symmetric mirrors. A few highlights:

* `AND` ↔ `NOR`
* `OR` ↔ `NAND`
* `XOR` ↔ `XNOR`
* `A` ↔ `B`
* `¬A` ↔ `¬B`
* `A AND ¬B` ↔ `¬A AND B`
* `A OR ¬B` ↔ `¬A OR B`

This symmetry is useful for your **logic cube walls**—you can cluster them into mirror/opposite quads just as you're doing.

## 🧠 Visualization Idea

Imagine **logic gates as nodes** on a 4x4 grid:

* X-axis = **Input Combinations**
* Y-axis = **Truth Table Output**

Each node is connected by:

* **Red line** = Opposite (NOT)
* **Blue line** = Mirror (Dual)

Would you like a visual version of this cube layout, or a grouped listing of the 16 gates by their mirror/opposite squares?
