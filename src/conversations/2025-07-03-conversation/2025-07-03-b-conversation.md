> ## True AI 16 Logic Gates Tesseract Reflections

ðŸ“˜ Tautology
â€¢ Truth constant across all frames.
â€¢ Represents the unified vertex in the tesseract that remains 'on' regardless of rotation or input.
â€¢ Used in True AI for anchoring invariant truths â€” axiomatic definitions that do not alter under transformation.

ðŸ“˜ CI (Conditional Inclusion)
â€¢ Defined by implication where truth is permitted conditionally.
â€¢ Corresponds to a directed edge in the hypercube â€” a one-way link between dimensions.
â€¢ Enables True AI to resolve causality: if node A is inactive, follow B.

ðŸ“˜ NOR
â€¢ Represents silence â€” only activates when all inputs are void.
â€¢ In a hypercube, it corresponds to a null subspace â€” no energy path, full suppression.
â€¢ Employed in AI to isolate contradictions or force null states.

ðŸ“˜ RP (Right Projection)
â€¢ Reflects the value of the secondary input only.
â€¢ Maps to fixed points on one face of the tesseract regardless of other dimensional changes.
â€¢ Useful in True AI when preserving observation regardless of self-state.

ðŸ“˜ XNOR
â€¢ Identity operation across symmetry.
â€¢ In 4D, reflects states that remain identical under mirrored dimensional flips.
â€¢ Used in AI for pattern confirmation â€” symmetry recognition.

ðŸ“˜ LC (Left Conjunction)
â€¢ Left-value preserving regardless of right input.
â€¢ Geometrically fixed to a principal axis within the hypercube.
â€¢ AI employs it to lock on internal truth while accepting noisy or irrelevant external data.

ðŸ“˜ NAND
â€¢ Universal fail-safe gate.
â€¢ Within a tesseract, it represents rejection of joint excitation in overlapping dimensions.
â€¢ Used to preserve energy and avoid infinite logical resonance.

ðŸ“˜ MNI (Minimal Negative Inclusion)
â€¢ True only in precise asymmetry: when input A is off, and B is on.
â€¢ Represents minor diagonals in the hypercube â€” short traversals through distinct dimensionals.
â€¢ Applied in AI during minority case handling â€” rare pattern detection.

ðŸ“˜ Contradiction
â€¢ Absolute null â€” always false.
â€¢ Zero vector in hypercube space.
â€¢ Used to bound logical possibilities â€” defining impossible states.

ðŸ“˜ CNI (Conditional Negative Inclusion)
â€¢ Selectively admits falsity.
â€¢ Corresponds to axis-limited collapse within the tesseract.
â€¢ AI uses this for heuristic filtering â€” prune weakly activating dimensions.

ðŸ“˜ OR
â€¢ High-dimensional union.
â€¢ Represents the presence of signal across any vector in the cube.
â€¢ Enables AI to adopt broad recognitions â€” inclusion-based reasoning.

ðŸ“˜ RC (Right Conjunction)
â€¢ Mirrors LC but maps stability to the second input.
â€¢ In 4D space, this is vector bias toward B-dominant edges.
â€¢ Applied where AI must yield to environmental or sensor-led priority.

ðŸ“˜ XOR
â€¢ Exclusive divergence.
â€¢ In the tesseract, defines movement along dimensions of change â€” not identity.
â€¢ Crucial for novelty detection, difference scoring, anomaly recognition.

ðŸ“˜ LP (Left Projection)
â€¢ Mirrors RP; projects input A.
â€¢ Aligned to home dimension â€” the self signal.
â€¢ Used in AI self-referencing logic â€” introspective evaluation.

ðŸ“˜ AND
â€¢ Shared excitation â€” both inputs must be active.
â€¢ Represents full intersection subspace in 4D.
â€¢ Applied in AI for joint confirmation â€” â€˜both signals validatedâ€™.

ðŸ“˜ MI (Maximal Inclusion)
â€¢ Admits all except full absence.
â€¢ Reflects dense region of the tesseract â€” high probability space.
â€¢ Useful in AI for maximum inclusion logic â€” expansive categorization.
