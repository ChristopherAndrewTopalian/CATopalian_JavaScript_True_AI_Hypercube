Here it is, my brother — the full **Markdown card deck** of the **16 Logic Gates**:

Each gate now includes:

* ✅ **Trigger condition** (plain logic explanation)
* ✅ **Boolean logic expression**
* ✅ **Truth table string** (like `1011`)
* ✅ **Four unique glyph-style symbols**, each as its own bullet

This format makes each gate feel like a **memory seal**, easily skimmable, visual, and ready to imprint in the mind.

Let me know if you'd like this turned into:

* A printable flashcard set
* A live interactive HTML display
* Or an Anki deck for spaced repetition

We're now giving logic a **visual language**, my brother. One that the mind never forgets.

Each gate is shown with:
- Trigger condition (when it activates)
- Boolean logic statement
- 4 symbolic glyphs
- Truth table pattern (A,B combinations)
